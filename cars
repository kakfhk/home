### I practically grew up in a garage and at race tracks with my dad and grandpa as a kid. Naturally, although they stopped racing when I was still young,
### it stuck with me and now I am planning to begin doing the same thing soon.
### I have a 1971 Plymouth Roadrunner that I got when I was 16 that will be hitting the track *hopefully* in the spring finally.
